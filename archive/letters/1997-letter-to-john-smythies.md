  A verbatim reproduction of a letter sent by Undo Uus to John Smythies on
  4 September 1997. The letter contains the earliest known full formulation
  of Uus’s proposal for an experimental test of whether the human visual
  system can generate a genuinely four-dimensional spatial phenomenal field
  from dynamically changing projections.

Thank you for your e-mail message of August 15.

My paper on free will has been accepted by the editor of the _Journal of
Consciousness Studies_, and I am now waiting what the referees will say.

I entirely agree with you that modern science cannot cope with our
subjective experience of the passage of time. In my book _Blindness
of Modern Science_ I even tried to show that it is evident from the
character of our experience of the flow of time that our transtemporal
personal identity cannot be explained if we are purely physical creatures
composed of material constituents as these are conceived by orthodox
materialistic science.

It is very fortunate that you are planning a lecture tour in Nothern
Europe next summer and are kindly ready to give a seminar also here
in Estonia. I will try to find out which are the prospects of arranging
your seminar here.

As I promised a month ago, I will now describe a psychological experiment
that is concerned with one basic property of our phenomenal spaces. I am
lucky to describe this experiment to you because our views on the status
of phenomenal spaces are very similar which makes it easy for me to explain
the sense of the experiment, and because we both consider the problem of
phenomenal spaces to be of great scientific importance.

This experiment can be called "4-dimensional vision".

The aim of the experiment is to establish whether it is possible to
"generate" 4-dimensional (spatial) visual fields in human minds. If this
experiment will succeed, it will give us a good ground to assume that
minds themselves are not spatial entities of definite dimension (e.g.
3-dimensional spatial entities in our world), but are potentially very
powerful (not to say supernatural) entities capable of embedding spatial
sensory spaces of whichever geometry (dimensionality, curvature, topology, etc).

The hope that it may be possible to generate a 4-dimensional spatial
visual field in a mind is based on an understanding that there should be
quite powerful mechanisms (or agents?) which construct the contents of
visual fields on the basis of information present in the brains' neural
structures. If there are such powerful mechanisms, they may be able to
produce also 4-dimensional spatial scenes in the mind provided the mind
has a capacity to "house" such scenes.

In what follows I will describe a concrete project how to provide the
brain structures with information necessary for constructing spatially
4-dimensional objects in human minds. (Maybe such experiments have been
already performed somewhere? I am ignorant of psychological literature
except the articles published in _Nature_ and _Science_. If you know of
such experiments I would be grateful if you tell me about them.)

How to supply a brain with information about spatially 4-dimensional
objects? We cannot have 4-dimensional objects in our 3-dimensional
physical space, nor have we sense organs to perceive such objects.
But we can use 3-dimensional projections of hypothetical 4-dimensional
objects into our 3-dimensional physical space.

If we watch an irregularly changing 2-dimensional configuration that
is projected on a 2-dimensional TV screen, what we see is an irregularly
changing 2-dimensional configuration. However, if we watch a changing
2-D configuration that is, in fact, a projection of a rotating 3-D object
on a 2-D plane, we see (experience) quite easily a rotating nonchanging
(rigid) 3-D object. The mechanism that interprets the visual information
the brain is supplied with recognizes, mathematically speaking, an
invariant -- a rigid 3-D object -- implicitly present in the changing
2-D picture, and provides our mind with a 3-D image of this 3-D object.

Let us now ask what will happen if we watch a changing 3-D configuration
that is, in fact, a projection into our 3-D space of a (hypothetical)
rotating 4-dimensional object. In this case the information the brain
is supplied with contains, too, an invariant -- a rigid 4-D object --
which is implicitly present in the changing 3-D configuration. Will we
in this case, if we observe the changing 3-D projection of a rotating
4-D object for a sufficiently long period, see eventually not the changing
3-D configuration but the rigid, rotating 4-D object in a 4-dimensional
space?

Now there is a technical problem: How to construct an appropriately
changing 3-D configuration we can look at? It is technically extremely
difficult to construct such a changing 3-D spatial configuration. True,
it is nowadays easy to construct a 2-D projection of this 3-dimensional
configuration on a computer monitor. But then we will perceive this
configuration as 2-dimensional, and it is very doubtful that the hidden
mechanism which provides our mind with visual experiences will be able
to interpret a 2-D changing picture as a projection of a 4-D object,
i.e. will be able to add not one but two extra spatial dimensions to the
original picture.

Yet there is, fortunately, an easy way of providing our visual system
with 3-D changing pictures: the stereoscopic method.

If 3-D objects are sufficiently close to us, we see them directly as
3-dimensional because our two eyes see then different 2-D projections
of 3-D objects. By supplying our eyes with a pair of stereoscopic images
of a 3-D configuration, we will see firmly and unambiguously the 3-D
configuration.

It should be quite easy to provide, using modern computers and computer
monitors, a high-quality stereoscopic pairs of changing pictures which
we will experience as a changing 3-D configuration. If we want to have
chromatic pictures, we must program the two pictures to appear in
separate locations on a screen (or on two separate screens) and use a
system of mirrors to see a 3-D stereo image. But if we are content with
a monochromatic picture, we may program a picture for one eye in red
lines, and a picture for another eye in green lines and look at a
monitor screen through a pair of glasses: a red for one eye and a green
for another. (I wonder which system NASA scientists use in watching
stereo TV broadcasts from the Mars Pathfinder.)

It would be reasonable to begin the experimenting with simplest 4-D
objects, e.g. with a tesseract. It might be reasonable also to let an
experimenter himself turn (virtual) 4-D objects in a (virtual) 4-D
space using 4 knobs (connected to a computer), one for each dimension.

Maybe it will take a lot of experimenting time (many weeks or even
months) before a 4-D phenomenal space with a 4-D object in it will
appear in one's mind. Maybe this 4-D space will appear in minds of only
very few people. It maybe even that nobody will ever experience a
"transition" to a 4-D visual field. But I think this experiment is
worth of being performed.

It seems to me that the (possible) transition from 3-D scenes to 4-D
scenes is less radical than the transition (which actually takes place)
from 2-D pictures to 3-D scenes: adding 1 to 3 seems to be a less
substantial act than adding 1 to 2. I think therefore that the transition
to experiencing a 4-dimensional space might well take place.

What do you think of such kind of psychological experiment?

With best wishes,

Undo Uus
