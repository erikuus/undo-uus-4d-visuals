# Archive

This directory contains the original source material related to Undo Uus’s four-dimensional visualization experiments conducted between 1997–2000.

The archive brings together:

- original QBasic source code,
- scanned paper originals,
- contemporaneous notes and correspondence,
- and reference recordings of the programs running in a DOS environment.

The purpose of this archive is preservation and validation.
No original material has been altered; modern reconstructions and visualizations are maintained outside the archive.

For interactive visualizations and modern reconstructions, see the project website and root README.
