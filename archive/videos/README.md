# Reference Videos

This folder contains screen recordings of the original QBasic programs running in a DOS emulator.

Each video corresponds to a `.bas` file in `archive/bas/` and shows the program executing with its original rendering logic, color palette, timing, and stereoscopic layout.

The videos are intended to:

- provide a visual reference without requiring emulator setup,
- support validation of modern reconstructions,
- document original behavior, pacing, and visual appearance.

These recordings are not modified beyond basic capture and compression.
