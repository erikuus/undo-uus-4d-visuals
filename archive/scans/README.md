# Scanned Originals

This folder contains scans of original paper materials related to the 4D visualization experiments.

These include printouts and handwritten or typed materials produced during the original development period (circa 1997–2000). The scans serve as primary evidence of the original work and provide a reference point for validating transcriptions and digital copies.

The QBasic source files in `archive/bas/` are transcriptions and may contain minor OCR or transcription inaccuracies. When in doubt, the scanned originals should be treated as authoritative.

Scans are provided as-is and have not been enhanced beyond basic digitization.
